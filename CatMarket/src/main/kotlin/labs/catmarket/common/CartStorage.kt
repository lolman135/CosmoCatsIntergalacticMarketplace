//In my case the storage looks like a repository, but in the future, it will have different logic.
//Repositories will operate with jpa entities and change data and DB. Storage is going to be
//an in-memory logic component (or redis, if I will have enough time to integrate it into project,
//but sounds as good idea).
//So in that case, it continues to lay here (till next discussion about this topic) :)
